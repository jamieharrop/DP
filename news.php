							<p><strong>Orlando</strong></p>

							<p>We're proud and excited to be able to finally announce our brand-new production for August's Edinburgh Festival Fringe...</p>

							<p>ORLANDO<br />
							Performed by Rebecca Vaughan.<br />
							Written and Directed by Elton Townend Jones</p>

							<p>It premieres from 2 – 27 August at Roxy Upstairs (11:30-13:00) as part of Assembly Festival</p>

							<p>This brand-new, contemporary production (based on the satirical 1928 novel by Virginia Woolf) sees the return of Dyad collaborators Martin Tucker (Lighting Design), Danny Bright (Sound Design), Kate Flanaghan (Costume design) and Ben Guest (Photography).</p>

							<p>Drawing on a decade’s worth of successful theatre-making, this introspective, but euphoric, feminist voyage is the culmination of everything Dyad has so far created, toured and presented across the world.</p>
