					<p><strong>Performed by Rebecca Vaughan</strong></p>

					<p><strong>Written and Directed by Elton Townend Jones</strong></p>

 					<p>Orlando: Who is she?  Who is he?  Who are we?  Find out in the life-affirming, comedic tale of an immortal poet, whose gender cannot be pinned down, whose spirit cannot be caged, and whose irreverent, romantic adventures across British history – from the 1600s to the present day – provide a magic-realist exploration of human identity; personal, sexual and national.  Drawing on a decade’s worth of critically-acclaimed theatre-making, Dyad Productions – performer Rebecca Vaughan and writer/director Elton Townend Jones – explore what it means to find our place in the world whilst remaining utterly true to who we are.  Based on the satirical 1928 novel by Virginia Woolf.</p>

					<p>From the creators of <em>Jane Eyre: An Autobiography, Dalloway, The Unremarkable Death of Marilyn Monroe, Christmas Gothic, I, Elizabeth, The Diaries of Adam and Eve, Female Gothic, he Time Machine</em> and <em>Austen's Women</em>.</p>
